<h4 align="justify">Im a senior mechatronics engineer, tinker and wayside system inspector, I try to apply a little of my experience to every project I get assigned. I find joy in learn new technologies that will help me in the future to create, develop and build new and better things</h4>
<h4 align="justify">With experience in KOP, FUP and AWL PLCs programming languages. I decided to start learning how to code in an specific programming language, such path introduced me to Python and later on to C++ even though I still have a long way ahead of me the challenge to keep develop a betterself makes me happy. I have worked with different organizations, companies and small startups, creating more efficient approaches and solutions to an existing process.
