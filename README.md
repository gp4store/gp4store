I decided to start learning how to code in an specific programming language, such path introduced me to Python and later on to C++ even though I still have a long way ahead of me the challenge to keep develop a betterself makes me happy. I have worked with different organizations, companies and small startups, creating more efficient approaches and solutions to an existing process.
